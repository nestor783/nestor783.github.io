title: Get Rid of Trojan Hourses Once and For All

---

### Method 1 of 2: Using anti-malware

Disable System Restore. Trojans have a nasty habit of infecting your System Restore points, which can cause your computer to continue to get infected, even after you remove the virus.[1]
Open your System properties. You can access this by right-clicking on Computer and selecting Properties. In Windows 8, press the Windows key + X and select System.
Click the “System protection” link.
Click the Configure button.
Disable system protection and delete all of the restore points saved on your computer. This will ensure that the virus does not replicate through System Restore. You can re-enable System Restore once the virus has been removed.
