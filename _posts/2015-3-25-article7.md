###Michael Jordan Story.

!n 1984, Adidas made big mistakes. Michael Jordan, who was playing Basketball in the  University of North Carolina, wanted a sponsorship deal with Adidas by the time he became professional player on the NBA.

According to someone who was an Adidas distributor at that time, he wanted to sign Michael Jordan. But heads of the company in Germany said that Michael Jordan was to short and they preferred to fine taller players. They said "We kept saying, ‘no—no one can relate to those guys. Who can associate with a seven-foot-tall guy?’ ”" 

Adidas signed centers of the era, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar—it still sells sneakers named for him. Mr. Jordan in 1984 signed with Nike, which built his name into a blockbuster basketball business. Mr. Jordan and Adidas decline to comment.
