Step 1: Create a div inside the body on the HTML file.

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Untitled Document</title>
</head>

<body>

#<div></div>


</body>
</html>


The most important languages to be learned are:

###HTML 

Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. 

Tutorial: [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

###CSS 

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. 

Tutorials: [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)  and [CSS MOre Tutorial](http://www.csstutorial.net/)

###JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. Programming makes computers do what you want them to do. 

Tutorials: [CodeAcademy JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) and [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)


There are so many ways to create a websites but depending on the requirements and functionalities of each one is necessary to use different technologies. If you want to take it to the next level I recommend to start thinking in taking some classes or even starting a career about it.
